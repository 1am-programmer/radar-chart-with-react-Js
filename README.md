# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




# React Radar Chart with Chart.js

This project demonstrates how to create a radar chart in React.js using Chart.js library.

## Introduction

Radar charts, also known as spider or star charts, are useful for displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart with three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. This project provides a simple example of implementing a radar chart in a React.js application using Chart.js library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1am-programmer/react-radar-chart.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-radar-chart
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You should see a radar chart displayed with sample data.

Customization
You can customize the radar chart by modifying the data and options passed to the Chart.js component in the RadarChart.js file. Chart.js provides extensive documentation on customization options available for radar charts, including axes configuration, colors, labels, and more. Refer to the Chart.js documentation for more information.
